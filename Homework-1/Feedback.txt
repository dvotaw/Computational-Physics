# HW grading scale: check(+) --> excellent (good code and analysis) 
#                   check    --> satisfactory (minor shortcomings in code and/or analysis)
#                   check(-) --> significant problems w/code or analysis

1) Problem 1 (area.cpp embellishments): 

Your code looks great. Nice job covering all possible cases for i/o. 

2)Problem 2 (sum up/down): 

Did you forget to push this code/figure? Oh wait, I see-- 
roundoff.cpp is the sum problem, and roundoff_distribution.cpp is 
the extra one.

Ok, in that case your figure looks right and your analysis is correct-- it's 
just a bit more complicated version of the 1+eps+eps... vs eps + eps +...+1 
problem we did in class. 

3) Problem 3 (bessel functions): 

Your code looks good and the analysis is on the money (in particular using the gsl 
result to figure out which is the culprit when the relative difference of the up/down 
is of order 1.)

(If interested, you can understand numerical value of the slope between x=1 and 10
using the short-distance x << l expressions of the spherical bessel and neumann functions. See Ch. 4 
notes. I wonder if one can play similar games for the VERY steep 
region above x = 30 using the asymptotic x >> l expressions for jl(x) and nl(x).)


4) Extra problem (roundoff distribution):
Yup, that's what I get...not quite Gaussian, and the "not quite" gets more pronounced as I 
do more points.


##### HW grade = check(++). 

Nice job. Your codes are very well written and easy to read,and you hit all the main points 
asked for in the analysis.
